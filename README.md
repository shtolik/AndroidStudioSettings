IntelliJ based Android Studio now allows to store settings in repository, allowing to sync them between PC, collegues. Why not.

This repo contains my personal prefered settings, most important of which are key bindings (based on Eclips key + set of other personal shortcuts), different colors in logCat for each level suitable for Darkula Theme. And personal set of navigation bars spread around the IDE corners in a way a like.
